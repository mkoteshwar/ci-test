Exercise 1: Creating Files in ECL
 Note: Run these from the user screen
 1. Creating Permanent Files:
 The @CAT statement catalogs a file in a master file directory without
 having it  assigned to the run.
 To use @CAT as a transparent statement, enter two masterspace (@)
 characters  instead of one
 Format :
 @CAT[,options] filename[,type/reserve/granule/maximum,pack-id-1/...
 /pack-id-n,,,ACR-name]

 Steps :
 a. To create and catalog a file named SAMPLE FILE, use:
 @CAT,P SAMPLEFILE
 b. To use the transparent statement to create and catalog a file named
 SAMPLEFILE2, use:
 @@CAT,P SAMPLEFILE2
 c. Verify that the files are created using the @PRT command.
 @PRT SAMPLEFILE.
 @PRT SAMPLEFILE2.


2. List Elements in a  file:
 Use the @PRT statement with the appropriate options to list all matching
 elements.
 Steps:
 a. To list all symbolic elements in a file named DPS, use:
 @PRT,TSV SYS$LIB$*DPS(3)./*
